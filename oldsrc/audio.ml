(* audio.ml
   Sound and music players.
   This also takes care of the music loader and unloader.
   Sound chunks are NOT freed.  They are hung onto by the Resource module.
   I hope I don't need too many...  Probably won't.
   If necessary, we can have a function that plays a sound and then frees
   it, or maybe modify the Resouce module to use weak pointers.
   
   (init_sound channels) MUST be called before any of the functions here!!
   Doing Sdl.init `AUDIO is probably also necessary.
   These are for music and sound respectively, probably.

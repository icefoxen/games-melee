So it's open-source, free software.  Anyone can mess with it.  Anyone can
start their own server and have their own arena and design their own mods.

BSD license.

Servers have no way of talking to each other.  People have no way of finding
out what servers exist.

So, create the Official Voidrunner League.  Anyone can go to the website and
see a certain selection of registered servers and mods.  Anyone can sign up
for free and see all the registered servers.  Anyone can get a paid
subscription that adds various services, announcements, and the option to
register their own server(s).

Hold monthly and annual tournements, for different mods, for different
leagues (light, medium, heavy, unlimited).  Charge $5 for entry, offer, say,
max( 10%, $100 ) as a prize.  Double these for the annual ones.  Fill 'em with
awsome stuff; make it an Event, use them to debut new features, mods,
codebases and changes.

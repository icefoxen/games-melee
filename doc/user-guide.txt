USER'S GUIDE, version 0.0
This is the guide for the basic, everyday user.

Compatability notes
Whatever binary you download should have everything you need to play the game
on your platform.  Supported platforms are:
Linux/x86 (other architectures might work if you compile from scratch)
Windows 2000/XP (The client might work on 95/98, but I'm not certain)
Mac OSX (should someone be so kind as to maintain it for me...)

Server/client stuff

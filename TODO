To do: Player ship selection
Energy, shields, and weapons
Death notification


Ship selection.  We need to let different players use different ships.  This
means sending various types of ships, and actually selecting them from the
typeindex (?) instead of just all using the same one.  This means sending a
list of various ships, etc...
Well, we send the client the list of ships in the handshake; we just need to
send the real ships.  That ends up being a protocol and UI issue.  So.


Death effects!
Ship systems, componants, energy, shields, radar, etc.
Efficient culling of objects-per-client --only sending nearby objects.
Collision detection!

Make player input and death messages send packets on keystate changes over
TCP?

SDL server terminal/map?
Server high scores?
Log files!

Credits screen!
Level editor!

MLGame console code?
Ghost players?
Fiddle a bit with shot directions and velocities


Hokay, I need a better handshake system; the players need to be able to choose
ships.
So, it will involve a few more steps.
0) C->S, client handshake & initial connection containing name, version and
IP.
1) S->C, server handshake containing ships amoung other things
2) C->S, client tells the server what ship it wants.
3) S->C, server says "go!"





GOALS!
*Strong community
*Team combat
*Able to play a quick duel with a few friends
*Play largely depends on skill
*Tournements!
*Theme/feeling?
*Gameplay speed?  Fast action vs. slower tactics...  MW is good 'cause it has
both.
*"Campaign" mode?  High-score board?  Some kind of persistance at least...
Don't get too fancy though.
